MyDigitalMommy

"My Digital Mommy" is a digital learning platform specifically designed for pre-schoolers. The learning platform ensures that parents are in control of the child's learning process. As a parent, you get to not only decide what your child learns but you also control how much time they spend on each of the activities. This is important because we strongly believe there is no one size fit all education or learning. Who knows better than a parent on where the child needs to focus on. As a parent, you can also allow your child to play some learning games through the platform. You are truly in control.
Now coming back to the most important audience of the "My Digital Mommy". The child. The interface is designed specifically for preschoolers. Its easy, simple, and fun, and most important it's relevant as it's designed by the person who knows you most.

While building the platform our team focussed on scalability too. The learning content can come from variety of platforms and technology.

In short "My Digital Mommy" is an attempt to have personalized learning for preschoolers delivered through the person who knows the preschooler the most.
